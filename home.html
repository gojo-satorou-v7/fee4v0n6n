                Dark patterns refer to deceptive design techniques employed in user interfaces to manipulate or trick individuals into 
                taking actions they may not otherwise choose to do. These patterns are often used in digital interfaces, such as websites 
                and apps, to influence user behavior for the benefit of the designer or the company, often at the expense of the user's best interests.
            </p>
            <p>
                User experience designer Harry Brignull coined the neologism on 28 July 2010 with the registration of 
                <a href="https://www.deceptive.design/"> darkpatterns.org,</a> a "pattern library with the specific goal 
                of naming and shaming deceptive user interfaces".
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2021 the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Consumer Reports created a tip line to collect information 
                about dark patterns from the public.
            </p><br><br>
            <h2>Types of Deceptive Patterns</h2>
            <p>The number and types of dark patterns are increasing day by day. As they are benificial for websites and services,
            they are in a race of creating some unique type of dark patterns which can be unrecognizable by the user. So, it is impossible
            to mention all the dark patterns.<br>
            However, we have tried to provide as much knowledge as available about the types of dark patterns are being used. <p><br>
            
            <h3>Confirmshaming</h3>
            <p>Confirmshaming works by triggering uncomfortable emotions, such as guilt or shame, to influence users' decision-making. 
            Websites or apps employing this deceptive pattern often present users with opt-out button labels that are worded in a 
            derogatory or belittling manner, making users feel bad about choosing not to engage with the offered service or feature. 
            By targeting users' emotions and self-image, confirmshaming aims to increase the likelihood that users will give in to 
            the desired action, ultimately benefiting the service provider. </p><br>
            
            <h3>Fake Scarcity</h3>
            <p>Fake scarcity works by creating an artificial sense of limited availability around a product or service, pushing users 
            to act quickly out of fear of missing out. This is achieved by displaying misleading messages about low stock levels or 
            high demand. By tapping into the scarcity cognitive bias, this deceptive pattern preys on users' natural tendency to assign 
            more value to items that appear rare or exclusive, pushing them into making hasty purchasing decisions without fully 
            evaluating their options.</p><br>

            <h3>Fake Social Proof</h3>
            <p>The fake social proof deceptive pattern creates an illusion of popularity and credibility by presenting users with 
            falsified or exaggerated endorsements, such as reviews, testimonials, or activity messages. This manipulation preys on 
            the social proof cognitive bias, in which which individuals are likely to conform to the behaviour of others. It is a 
            shortcut that allows people to avoid the hard work of carrying out a critical evaluation of their own. By using the fake 
            social proof deceptive pattern, providers can trick users into making a purchase or engaging with their offerings.</p><br>

            <h3>Fake Urgency</h3>
            <p>When a user is placed under time pressure, they are less able to critically evaluate the information shown to them 
            because they have less time and may experience anxiety or stress. Providers can use this to their advantage, to push 
            them into completing an action that may not entirely be in the user's interest.</p><br>

            <h3>Forced Action</h3>
            <p>Forced action involves a provider offering users something they want - but requiring them to do something in return. 
            It may be combined with other deceptive patterns like sneaking (so users don't notice it happening) or trick wording 
            (to make the action seem more desirable than it is). Sometimes an optional action is presented as a forced action, 
            through the use of visual interference or trick wording. In cookie consent interfaces, forced action is sometimes 
            carried out through "bundled consent". This involves combining multiple agreements into a single action, and making it 
            hard or impossible for a user to selectively grant consent.</p><br>
